COMMANDS
========

#startmeeting
  Starts a meeting.

#endmeeting
  End a meeting, save logs, restore previous topic, give links to
  logs.  You know the drill.

#topic
  Set the current topic of discussion.  MeetBot changes the topic in
  the channel (saving the original topic to be restored at the end of
  the meeting).

#meetingtopic
  Sets the "meeting topic".  This will always appear in the topic in
  the channel, even as the #topic changes.  The format of the IRCtopic
  is "<topic> (Meeting Topic: <meeting topic>)".

#save
  Write out the logs right now.

#agreed (alias #agree)
  Mark something as agreed on.  The rest of the line is the details.

#accepted (alias #accept)
  Mark something as agreed on.  The rest of the line is the details.

#rejected (alias #reject)
  Mark something as agreed on.  The rest of the line is the details.

#chair and #unchair
  Add new chairs to the meeting.  The rest of the line is a list of
  nicks, separated by commas and spaces.  The nick which started the
  meeting is the ``owner`` and can't be de-chaired.

#undo
  Remove the last item from the meeting minutes.  Only applies to
  commands which appear in the final output.

#restrictlogs
  When logs are saved, remove the permissions specified in the
  configuration variable ``RestrictPerm``

#lurk and #unlurk
  When ``lurk`` is set, MeetBot will only passively listen and take
  notes (and save the notes), not reply or change the topic  This is
  useful for when you don't want disruptions during the meeting.

#meetingname
  Provide a friendly name which can be used as a variable in the
  filename patterns.  For example, you can set 
  filenamePattern = '%(channel)s/%%Y/%(meetingname)s.%%F-%%H.%%M'
  to allow #meetingname to categorize multiple types of meeting
  occurring in one channel.

  All spaces are removed from the rest of the line and the string is
  converted to lowercase.  If ``meetingname`` is not provided, it
  defaults to ``channel``.

#action
  Add an ``ACTION`` item to the minutes.  Provide irc nicks of people
  involved, and there will be a listing of action items sorted by nick
  at the end of the meeting.

#info
  Add an ``INFO`` item to the minutes.

#idea
  Add an ``IDEA`` to the minutes.

#help (alias #halp)
  Add a ``HELP`` item to the minutes.  Confusingly, this does *not* give
  supybot help.  See #commands.

#nick
  Make a nick be recognized by supybot, even though it hasn't said
  anything.  This is only useful in order to make a list of action
  items be grouped by this nick at the end of the meeting.

#link
  Add a link to the minutes.  The URL must be the first thing on the
  line, separated by a space from the rest of the line, and it will be
  properly hyperlinked.  This is automatically detected if the line
  starts with http:, https:, mailto:, and some other common protocols
  defined in the ``UrlProtocols`` configuration variable.

#commands
  List recognized supybot commands.  This is the better "help" command.


LESS-USED COMMANDS
==================




ADMIN COMMANDS
==============

These commands are for the bot owners to.  The expected use is when
the bot is on many channels as a public service, and the bot owner
sometimes needs to be able to monitor and adjust the overall
situation.

All of these are regular supybot commands (as opposed to the commands
above).  That means that the supybot capability system applies, and
they can be given either in any channel, either by direct address
(``BotName: <command> <args> ...``) or with the bot prefix character
(``@<commandname> <args> ...``).

These are restricted to anyone with the ``admin`` capability on the
bot.

``listmeetings``
  List all meetings.

``savemeetings``
  Saves all active meetings on all channels and all networks.

``addchair <channel> <network> <nick>``
  Forcibly adds this nick as a chair on the giver channel on the given
  network, if a meeting is active there.

``deletemeeting <channel> <network> <saveit=True>``
  Delete a meeting from the cache.  If save is given, save the meeting
  first.  The default value of ``save`` is True.
